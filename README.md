# Rent a chef
Rent a chef is an visual idea of discussions i had during the pandemic when i worked as an salesmanager within the techsector selling software to hotells and resturants.
During this hard period it was almost impossible to pitch our products becuase of the restrictions. Because of the situation new ideas was invented how to keep the buisness going and i had a few dialogs with buisness owners and we were talking about how to have an income from distans. The website is an idea of an online resturant where people can se how the chefs are working in the kitchen to create a full menu that contains a starter, main course and dessert.

**Footer**
- Footer contains 4 social media icons which can be opened in new tabs. This is a great way to communicate with information that is not displayed on the website. Customers would be able to se the next weeks menu, wich chefs that are working and different events to decide future menues.
-  At this point the social media plattforms have not been created yet.
