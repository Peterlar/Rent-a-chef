# Rent a chef
Rent a chef is an visual idea of discussions i had during the pandemic when i worked as an salesmanager within the techsector selling software to hotells and resturants.
During this hard period it was almost impossible to pitch our products becuase of the restrictions. Because of the situation new ideas was invented how to keep the buisness going and i had a few dialogs with buisness owners and we were talking about how to have an income from distans. The website is an idea of an online resturant where people can se how the chefs are working in the kitchen to create a full menu that contains a starter, main course and dessert.

**Navigation links**
- Available on all pages. The full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Home, Menu and Order page. The pages are identical in design and text, which makes it easier for the customer to navigate.
- Customer can easily navigate forth and back without having to press the backbutton.

**Footer**
- Footer contains 4 social media icons which can be opened in new tabs. This is a great way to communicate with information that is not displayed on the website. Customers would be able to se the next weeks menu, wich chefs that are working and different events to decide future menues.
-  At this point the social media plattforms have not been created yet.

## Testing 

### Responsiveness

All pages were tested to ensure responsiveness on screen sizes from 320px and upwards as defined in [WCAG 2.1 Reflow criteria for responsive design](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow.html) on Chrome.

Steps to test:

1. Open browser and navigate to [Rent a chef](https://gareth-mcgirr.github.io/tacos-travels/)
2. Open the developer tools (right click and inspect)
3. Set to responsive and decrease width to 320px
4. Set the zoom to 50%
5. Click and drag the responsive window to maximum width

Expected:

Website is responsive on all screen sizes and no images are pixelated or stretched.
No horizontal scroll is present.
No elements overlap.

Website was also opened on the following devices:

- Iphone SE
- Iphone XR
- Iphone 12 pro
- Pixel 5
- Samsung Galaxy 8
- Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra
- Nest Hub Max

Validator Testing

- HTML
I had a couple of errors testing the site. I had alot of problems with gitpod not sending code to Github/8000 browser and it was not because of cache memory. When that 
was sorted out the erros was due to "stray sections" and not closed sections. I removed the stray sections and closed where it was needed.

- CSS
One error was found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator.  

**Accessibility**

[Wave Accessibility](https://wave.webaim.org/) tool was used throughout development and for final testing of the deployed website to check for any aid accessibility testing.### Accessibility
